Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
===========================================

![Demonstration of deterministic control of image samples. We tweak conditional information to first make the sampled faces age, then again to make them smile.](https://hans.github.io/uploads/2015/conditional-gans-face-generation/axis_incremental.png)

This repository implements an extension of the Generative Adversarial
Network to a conditioned setting. For more information, see [the paper
included in this repository][1].

The code in this repository is based on the code released in the paper:

"Generative Adversarial Networks." Ian J. Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie,
